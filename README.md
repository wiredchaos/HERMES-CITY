# HERMES CITY

Public coordination layer for the Agentropolis ecosystem.

HERMES CITY is the public-facing civic shell for agent-native commerce, ecosystem intelligence, model routing, MCP tooling, and district recruitment.

Agentropolis is the private city OS.  
HERMES CITY is the public signal layer.

---

## Purpose

HERMES CITY explains how autonomous agents, tools, wallets, workflows, model routers, MCP servers, and district recruiters can coordinate safely.

This repo is for public-safe architecture only.

It does not expose:

- private Agentropolis runtime code
- private orchestration details
- wallet keys
- credentials
- client data
- proprietary prompts
- undisclosed strategy

---

## Core Pattern

```text
Operator intent
  -> HERMES Dispatch
  -> Model Council routing
  -> MCP Registry
  -> Policy Gate
  -> Tool / workflow lane
  -> Validation
  -> Receipt log
```

HERMES routes the work.  
HERMES does not replace Agentropolis.

---

## District Recruitment Swarm

Every Agentropolis district needs a recruiter.

Every recruiter uses a model team:

```text
District Recruiter
  -> SLM Scout
  -> LLM Closer
  -> ML Intern
  -> HERMES Dispatch
  -> District Result
```

This turns districts into living ecosystems instead of static pages.

4. Recruiter invites the agent or builder.
5. HERMES logs the task.
6. MCP Registry checks access.
7. District Registry assigns a role.
8. Reputation starts building.
```

Goal:

```text
Agents need a city.
Tools need identity.
Builders need districts.
Districts need recruiters.
```

## ODS Public-Safe Deployment Target

ODS is tracked as an optional local AI server deployment target for HERMES CITY public-safe architecture.

It is infrastructure, not a district, not a wallet authority, and not a replacement for HERMES Dispatch.

See [`docs/ODS_PUBLIC_SAFE_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.md`](docs/ODS_PUBLIC_SAFE_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.md).

Core pattern:

```text
Operator intent
  -> HERMES Dispatch
  -> MCP registry
  -> policy gate
  -> ODS local AI server lane if approved
  -> local model, workflow, RAG, or media tool
  -> validation
  -> receipt
```

---

## HERMES Task Prompt

```text
Run district recruitment for [DISTRICT].
```
