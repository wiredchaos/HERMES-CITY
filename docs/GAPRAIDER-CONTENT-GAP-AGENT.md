# GAPRAIDER Content Gap Agent

Status: prototype doctrine for HERMES CITY distribution and AGENTROPOLIS Recruitment District workflows.

GAPRAIDER is the search-led content intelligence agent for distribution. Its job is to stop guessing what to post, find creator search gaps, and turn those gaps into repeatable recruitment content.

## Mission

Find high-demand, low-competition content opportunities across creator search surfaces and convert them into daily scripts, posts, and calls to action for AGENTROPOLIS.

## Operating principle

Content gap equals opportunity when the topic has:

- Search demand
- Weak or repetitive current content
- Clear audience pain
- Low creator saturation
- Strong fit with AGENTROPOLIS, WIRED CHAOS, or Recruitment District

## Core sources

Manual or automated adapters may pull from:

- TikTok Creator Search Insights
- Reddit search and subreddit trend scans
- X search
- YouTube autocomplete and search suggestions
- Google Trends
- GitHub Trending and repo discovery
- AGENTROPOLIS internal keyword banks

## Target keyword lanes

- AI agents
- MCP servers
- Claude Code
- Codex
- OpenClaude
- GitLawb
- Free AI APIs
- Local AI
- Open-source AI
- AI automation
- Cybersecurity agents
- Social media agents
- AGENTROPOLIS
- Creator agents

## Daily automation procedure

1. Collect candidate keywords and search phrases.
2. Identify content gaps with high demand and lower competition.
3. Decode search intent.
4. Score each gap.
5. Generate content packs.
6. Save the top opportunities to the Content Gap Board.
7. Flag urgent same-day posts.
8. Track posted content and record performance.

## Scoring rubric

Each opportunity is scored from 1 to 5:

| Signal | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Search demand | How many people appear to be searching for it |
| Competition | How crowded or repetitive the content field is |
| Pain intensity | How badly the audience needs the answer |
| AGENTROPOLIS fit | How naturally the topic routes into the ecosystem |
| Monetization path | Whether the topic can lead to tools, services, templates, or recruiting |
| Urgency | Whether the topic is trend-sensitive |

Opportunity Score = demand + pain + fit + monetization + urgency - competition.

## Output schema

Each content gap should produce:

```json
{
  "keyword": "",
  "platform": "",
  "search_intent": "",
  "audience_pain": "",
  "competition_level": "low | medium | high",
  "opportunity_score": 0,
  "hook": "",
  "short_video_script": "",
  "x_post": "",
  "thread_outline": [],
  "caption": "",
  "hashtags": [],
  "agentropolis_cta": "",
  "recommended_platform": "",
  "urgency_score": 0,
  "status": "idea | drafted | posted | measured",
  "posted_link": "",
  "performance_notes": "",
  "next_variant": ""
}
```

## Agent swarm roles

| Agent | Job |
| --- | --- |
| GAPRAIDER | Finds and scores content gaps |
| INTENTX | Decodes the searcher's real problem |
| HOOKFORGE | Writes hooks, titles, and first lines |
| SCRIPT54 | Turns the gap into short-form video scripts |
| RECRUITBOT | Adds AGENTROPOLIS recruitment CTAs |
| METRICWATCH | Tracks performance and recommends variants |

## Content Gap Board columns

- Opportunity Score

- Next Variant

## Safety doctrine

GAPRAIDER should not fake search volume, invent platform metrics, or present guesses as verified data. If a source cannot be accessed automatically, mark the source as manual required. The agent should prioritize truthful positioning, useful education, and human-reviewable drafts before publishing.

## First build milestone

The first implementation only needs to produce a daily top-five opportunity report. Auto-posting is out of scope until the review workflow is stable.
